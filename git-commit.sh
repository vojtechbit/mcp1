git commit -m "feat: Complete advanced features implementation

Major features added:
- Minimal ENV config with derived limits from REQUEST_BUDGET_15M
- Rate limiting (standard + heavy for aggregate/batch/bulk)
- Pagination with aggregate mode (mail, calendar, tasks)
- Snapshot tokens for stable iteration (2min TTL)
- ETag/304 caching for all GET endpoints

Mail enhancements:
- include=summary (OFF by default, batched internally)
- normalizeQuery=true (diacritics, alias expansion)
- relative time (today/tomorrow/thisWeek/lastHour) using Unix timestamps
- Batch endpoints: batchPreview, batchRead with auto-routing
- Send-to-self with confirmSelfSend requirement

Contacts improvements:
- Renamed property → realEstate (columns A-E)
- Always append, never auto-merge
- Returns duplicates array for assistant suggestions
- Bulk operations: bulkUpsert, bulkDelete
- Address suggestions with fuzzy matching (Jaro-Winkler)

Fixes:
- Relative time now uses Unix timestamps for accurate timezone handling
- All dates converted to seconds since epoch for Gmail API compatibility
- Europe/Prague timezone properly handled
